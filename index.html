    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Neon Pong (“we”, “our”, or “the app”) handles user data.</p>

    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>The app does not collect or store personal information such as your name, email, phone number, or location.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>If the app requests any permissions (camera, storage, Bluetooth, network access, etc.), these are used only for
        the core functionality of the app and never transmitted to us.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, tracking, or data-collection services unless stated
        here. If such services are added in the future, their privacy policies will be linked here.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The app does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you believe data has been collected
        accidentally, contact us and we will remove it.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page.</p>
